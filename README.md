# bitUI Project

Welcome to **bitUI**, a modular and lightweight, minimalist UI Kitk built by BitNations. bitUI provides a flexible, customizable, and user-friendly UI solution for developers, inspired by the BitNations ecosystem. This repository serves as both the source code for bitUI and a static website acting as documentation and a landing page for the framework.

## Project Overview

bitUI is designed to help developers create modern, responsive, and visually appealing user interfaces with minimal effort. It includes a collection of CSS styles, JavaScript utilities, and HTML templates that you can download, customize, and integrate into your projects. The framework is open-source and free for anyone to use under the MIT License.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)

### View the Landing Page
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to explore the documentation and landing page.
2. No additional setup is required for viewing the static site.

### Download bitUI for Use
1. Visit the landing page (`index.html`) and click the **"Download CSS"** button to get a ZIP file containing:
   - `bitui.css`: The compiled CSS styles for bitUI.
   - `demo.html`: A sample HTML file demonstrating bitUI usage.
   - `LICENSE.txt`: The MIT License governing bitUI’s use.
2. Extract the ZIP file and use the provided files in your project.
3. Use the HTML structure and classes (e.g., `.row`, `.col-6`, `.panel`) as shown in `demo.html` to build your UI.

## Using bitUI
bitUI provides a simple, class-based system for creating layouts and components. Key features include:

- A responsive grid system (e.g., `.row`, `.col-12`, `.col-6`).
- Predefined panel styles (e.g., `.panel`, `.panel-light`, `.panel-dark`).
- CSS variables for easy customization (e.g., `--bg-color`, `--text-color`).
- Lightweight and modular design for fast loading.

Refer to the `demo.html` file and the landing page for examples and documentation on usage.

## Project Goals
1. Develop a lightweight, modular, and extensible UI kit.
2. Provide a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for web applications.
3. Ensure compatibility with modern browsers and accessibility standards.
4. Offer documentation and examples for developers.
