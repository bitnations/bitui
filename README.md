# BitUI Project

Welcome to the BitUI project! This project aims to create a front-end framework based on the BitNations UI. The current setup serves as a static website that will function as both documentation and a landing page for the framework.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
bitui-project
├── src
│   ├── index.html        # Main HTML document for the static website
│   ├── styles
│   │   └── main.css      # CSS styles for the website
│   └── scripts
│       └── main.js       # JavaScript code for interactivity
├── assets                 # Directory for additional assets (images, fonts, etc.)
├── README.md              # Documentation for the project
└── .gitignore             # Files and directories to ignore by version control
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open `src/index.html` in your web browser to view the landing page.
